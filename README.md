# gentoo-patches
Patches that are used in gentoo ebuilds.

# www-client/seamonkey
With www-client/seamonkey-2.53.10.2 and before the ebuild fetched most patches
from a central webspace. Here we uncouple this and fetch the patches directly
from this github repo. This allows for keeping track of changes made to them.

# Patch numbering
Please use appropriate numbering scheme when adding patches.
All patches must contain a bug url for tracking purposes, unless.
they are build modifications specific to Gentoo. Example would be
disable sdk install, path modifications. User patches need to be sent.
upstream to ensure we can drop them as quick as possible.
